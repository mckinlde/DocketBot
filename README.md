  Secure login flow with stubbed cloud-based license validation.

  A standalone desktop GUI with redirected output for easy feedback and error tracking.

- üíæ **Persistent Configuration**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckinlde/DocketBot.git

````

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions

To build the standalone `.exe` file:

---

## üß™ Useful Code Snippets

### Clear stdout inside GUI

```python
sys.stdout = StdoutRedirector(text_widget)
```

```python
os.makedirs(os.path.join(root_dir, attorney, docket_id), exist_ok=True)
```

### Config file format (`config.ini`)

```ini
[credentials]
docket_id = example123
password = secret
save_credentials = True

[paths]
root_directory = C:/Users/.../CourtDocs
```

## ‚ùó Known Issues

* `chrome.dll` lock may cause PyInstaller to fail; ensure all Chrome-related processes are closed.
* `pytest` warning on `bs4.tests` is harmless unless testing support is required.
* Pushing to GitHub with SSH may fail unless your key is configured; HTTPS is recommended unless you're using a credential helper.

---

## üìå TODO (future features)

* [ ] Validate license against real cloud API
* [ ] Enable login credentials saving and auto-fill securely
* [ ] Progress bar or status messages in GUI
* [ ] Add retry logic and error handling for failed downloads
* [ ] Portable app bundle with ChromeDriver + headless Chromium
* [ ] Expand support for multiple attorneys or filters
* [ ] Add "Open Case Folder" button in GUI
