## 🧠 Summary of What You’ve Built (and What You’re Aiming For)

You are distributing a **self-contained app folder**, built with `PyInstaller --onedir`, that:

### ✅ Features

* Runs as a `.exe` GUI app
* Persists user settings to `LOCALAPPDATA\DocketBot\config.json`
* Performs a license check on startup
* Works whether the user:

  * Leaves it in the folder
  * Moves `DocketBot.exe` to Desktop
  * Creates their own shortcut manually
* Requires **no install step**, **no external Python**, and **no config editing**

## 📁 Final Shared Structure (zipped folder)

```plaintext
dist/
└── DocketBot/
    ├── DocketBot.exe        ← this is your app
    ├── python*.dll          ← PyInstaller-included DLLs
    ├── library.zip
    ├── (other .pyd/.dll/.pyc files)
```

> You will **zip the `DocketBot/` folder**, name it `DocketBot-Windows.zip`, and share it.

---

## 🧪 What the User Does

1. Download and unzip `DocketBot-Windows.zip`
2. Double-click `DocketBot.exe`
3. Use it. Done.

✔️ App works
✔️ Settings persist
✔️ License check runs
✔️ No install required

---

## 🛑 Installer Later

Eventually, when you want:

* Start menu integration
* Program Files install
* Uninstallers, versioning

…you’ll add a second `.exe` like `Installer.exe` that copies the folder and creates those integrations. But **not now**.

You’ve officially picked the cleanest, simplest dev-friendly path forward. You're ready to ship.
