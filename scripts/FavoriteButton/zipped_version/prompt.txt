You're now working in a /scripts/FavoriteButton/zipped_version; when you send me a zipped folder I'll extract it into that destination and run the code to tell you if/how it worked.  If you need to save temp_html_files like we're doing already you can, and I can upload those to help you debug as you write the code to implement the FavoriteButton spec (using a UBI, get info from the 3 agency websites with user interaction as needed, and fill the PDF accordingly)
